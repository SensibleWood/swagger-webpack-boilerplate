Overview
===

This is boilerplate project for running Swagger UI with Webpack. I created it as I wanted a simple way of bundling Swagger UI and API specifications into a runnable project.

Sure there's other ways of doing it, but still...

Usage
===

To use this project:

* Copy YAML-encoded Swagger/OpenAPI files to `src/specs`
* `npm i`
* `npm run dev`

Improvements
===

[ ] Convert the rewrite-urls.js script to a Webpack plugin
